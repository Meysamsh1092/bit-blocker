 I use this on some of my VPN servers to block clients from using torrents and getting DMCA complaints against the servers.

 ## Installation

To use this script, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meysamsh1092/bit-blocker/main/bt.sh && chmode +x bt.sh && bash bt.sh
```
